This is a short 3-hour tutorial designed to teach 
the basics of using a high-performance computing cluster.
This tutorial focuses on SLURM as a scheduler and
the Lmod modules system, 
but the general concepts are applicable to any HPC installation.

## Setup

This tutorial assumes that you have an SSH client pre-installed.

**Windows** - Though any SSH client will work, 
we recommend using [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net).
The reason for this is that it has a built-in file browser, X server, 
and local bash shell-
all things that can be a little tricky to setup on Windows otherwise.

**macOS** - If you are a Mac user, you'll want to install [XQuartz](www.xquartz.org).
Even if you've got it preinstalled, we recommend installing the latest version
and then rebooting your computer.
Unlike most Mac software, XQuartz only takes effect after a full reboot.

**Linux** - If you are a Linux user, there is nothing to install!
You are set to go!
